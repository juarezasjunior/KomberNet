# Code of Conduct

We all want to act and interact in ways that contribute to have a healthy community.

Some unacceptable behavior include:

- Use sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Public or private harassment
- Personal or political attacks
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Promote protests of any matter
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Demonstrating an inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, 
the consequence will be a permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
